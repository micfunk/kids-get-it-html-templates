# Setup

Make sure you have Ruby installed on your machine. Ruby comes installed on Macs.

1. `cd` into this directory.
2. Run `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000`
3. Go to localhost:5000 in your browser.

You can also just open the index.html file in a browser by going to file > open -- but it will not load anything from the CDNs (bootstrap, jquery) so you can't use any scripts with this setup.
